= VDI Handler Components

This directory contains component libraries that the VDI Plugin Handler Service
depends on.

`http-errors`:: A middleware layer for KTOR that defines exceptions similar to
Jax-RS' `WebApplicationException` types and maps those exception types to HTTP
error responses.

`io-utils`:: Various IO classes that wrap `InputStream` or `OutputStream`
instances to provide some custom functionality.

`json`:: JSON utilities.

`script-execution`:: Wrappers for Java's `Process` and `ProcessBuilder` types
that are interface based and thus can be mocked for unit testing purposes.
